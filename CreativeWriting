The hero is unable to rescue the damsel in distress, but the army comes and rescues them both from the dragon,
only to find himself having to foot the bill for their rescue; the King demonstrates the (in retrospect, obvious)
lack of preparedness of a hero from some rural village who had only had two weeks' worth of training from some
so-called "master" whose skills were so weak he was unable to even save himself, trusting in some hope of "inheritance"
and a cobbled-together rogues gallery instead of a carefully-selected team.
